Wyatt is designed to be a modular and *testable* framework for developing robot code. It provides structures for unit testing your robot code, as well as a framework for abstracting hardware to make it easy to adapt your code to whichever system you are running on. 

# [](#header-1)Motivations

The primary motivation behind this project was that there wasn't a decent framework for smaller robots that allowed for easy unit testing. There are projects like [WPILib](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib) which is used in the FIRST robotics competition which provide similar communication and command structures to Wyatt's, however WPILib does not at its core provide a way of unit testing your code. 

# [](#header-1)Installation

Wyatt will run on Linux or Mac (sorry, no Windows support yet).

  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```
